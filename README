 HTML5 Minecraft
-----------------

This project is a continuation of the former SVN project by the same name, hosted at Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/html5-minecraft/).

This project is intended to be my 5% project that will help me master the art of game development, HTML5 game development, 3D rendering with WebGL, and finally, GWT. Since that is kind of a long list of very different items, I shall use my current experience with vanilla JavaScript?, and leave the GWT port to the end.
